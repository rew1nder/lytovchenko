# Project Summary
TaskSorter is a web application that exemplifies the Strategy design pattern through a robust task management system. Users can create, edit, and sort tasks using various strategies (by date, priority, and alphabetically), enhancing productivity and demonstrating clean coding practices. The application has recently been improved to include user-friendly features such as task completion buttons and enhanced text handling.

# Project Module Description
- **Task Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete tasks with attributes like title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Sorting Strategies**: Implemented sorting functionality using different strategies, allowing users to dynamically switch between sorting methods.
- **User Interface**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed with a dedicated button.
- **Text Handling**: Improved text input for task descriptions, supporting line breaks and overflow handling.
