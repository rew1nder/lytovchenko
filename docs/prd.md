## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Requirements Analysis

The application must implement the Strategy design pattern to manage different task sorting algorithms. This pattern allows the algorithm's selection to be changed at runtime based on user preference. The application should have a clean architecture with clear separation between the UI and the sorting strategies.

The Strategy pattern will be implemented as follows:
- A `SortStrategy` interface that defines a common method for all concrete sorting strategies
- Multiple concrete strategy classes (e.g., `DateSortStrategy`, `PrioritySortStrategy`, `AlphabeticalSortStrategy`)
- A context class (`TaskList`) that uses the selected strategy to perform sorting

The app should store user tasks with proper metadata and provide a responsive interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 3.2 Requirements Pool

#### P0 (Must-have)

1. User must be able to create new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority level
2. User must be able to view a list of all tasks
3. User must be able to sort tasks using at least 3 different strategies (by date, by priority, alphabetically)
4. User must be able to mark tasks as complete
5. The application must implement the Strategy design pattern for the sorting mechanism
6. The interface must be responsive and work on desktop and mobile devices

#### P1 (Should-have)

1. User should be able to edit existing tasks
2. User should be able to delete tasks
3. User should be able to filter tasks (completed/active)
4. User should be able to see the current sorting strategy visually indicated
5. Tasks should be stored persistently (local storage or database)

#### P2 (Nice-to-have)

1. User may be able to create custom sorting strategies
2. User may be able to categorize tasks with tags or categories
3. User may be able to set recurring tasks
4. Application may include data visualization of task completion
5. Application may have dark mode support

### 3.3 UI Design Draft

The application will feature a clean, minimalist interface with the following components:

### 3.4 Technical Architecture

The application will implement the Strategy design pattern as follows:

```javascript
// Strategy Interface
interface SortStrategy {
  sort(tasks: Task[]): Task[];
}

// Concrete Strategies
class DateSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
  sort(tasks: Task[]): Task[] {
    return [...tasks].sort((a, b) => a.dueDate - b.dueDate);
  }
}

class PrioritySortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
  sort(tasks: Task[]): Task[] {
    const priorityValues = { high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1 };
    return [...tasks].sort((a, b) => priorityValues[b.priority] - priorityValues[a.priority]);
  }
}

class AlphabeticalSortStrategy implements SortStrategy {
  sort(tasks: Task[]): Task[] {
    return [...tasks].sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title));
  }
}

// Context
class TaskList {
  private tasks: Task[] = [];
  private sortStrategy: SortStrategy;

  constructor(sortStrategy: SortStrategy) {
    this.sortStrategy = sortStrategy;
  }

  setSortStrategy(sortStrategy: SortStrategy) {
    this.sortStrategy = sortStrategy;
  }

  addTask(task: Task) {
    this.tasks.push(task);
  }

  getSortedTasks(): Task[] {
    return this.sortStrategy.sort(this.tasks);
  }
}
```

### 3.5 Open Questions

1. Should the application support multiple task lists or projects?
2. Is user authentication required for this version?
3. Should the application support collaboration between multiple users?
4. Are there any specific accessibility requirements?
5. Should tasks support attachments or links to external resources?

## 4. Implementation Plan

- Set up database connection (MongoDB or similar)

### 4.3 Testing
